## Xiaoqi Tan's Bio

I am a postdoc at the [Dept. of ECE](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/).  

I am also working with [Raouf Boutaba](http://rboutaba.cs.uwaterloo.ca/) from [David R. Cheriton School of Computer Science](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/), [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/).  

Prior to joining UofT, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu). [Here](/resume) is my short resume. 

I occasionally write [blog posts](/post) about my research updates, or other interesting concepts in mathematics and economics that are relevant to CS + EE.

## <a id="research"></a> Research Interests

I work on problems at the intersection of _`Online Algorithms`_, _`Algorithmic Game Theory`_, and _`Machine Learning`_,  with a focus on applications to Networks and Energy, such as _`Communications`_, _`Cloud Computing`_,  and _`Smart Grid`_. Click [here](/research) for more details.


[comment]: # (I study how to handle uncertainty and incentives in networks and energy systems. Current topics of interest include: I work on problems at the intersection of [Online Algorithms](/#online-algorithms), [Algorithmic Game Theory](/#algorithmic-game-theory-mechanism-design), and [Mechanism Design](/#algorithmic-game-theory-mechanism-design), with applications to [Cloud Computing, Networking, and Energy Systems](/#applications). ..... I work on problems at the intersection of `Online Algorithms`,  `Algorithmic Game Theory`, and `Mechanism Design`, with an emphasis on applications to `Distributed and Networked Systems` ranging from  large-scale cloud computing platforms to computer networks and  energy systems. my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=drR_WcAAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) with theoretic performance guarantees and analyses with a focus on applications to `Cloud Computing`, `Communication Networks`, and `Transactive Energy Systems`.  My research interests revolve around fundamental and algorithmic issues in computing, communication, and energy systems.  Beyond my work on applications, I also work on problems at the intersection of online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, and mechanism design. The goal is to develop foundational theory and algorithms for online decision making in the presence of incomplete information, using mathematical tools from computer science, economics, and operations research. Some specific topics of interest include online knapsack problems, online mechanism design, online scheduling, combinatorial auctions, and prophet inequalities. Though diverse, the above areas are all essential to my broader research  goal: developing foundational  algorithms and tools to help improve the sustainability of ICT, or more broadly, to enable a sustainable energy future. Some primary topics in my research include: - [Online Algorithms](/#online-algorithms). Online Optimization and Online Learning. - [Algorithmic Game Theory](/#algorithmic-game-theory). Online Combinatorial Auctions and Mechanism Design. - [Communication Networks](/#networks). Cloud Computing, Network Optimization, and Network Economics. - [Energy Systems](/#energy). Electric Vehicle Networks and  Smart Grid.)
