## <span style="color:darkred"> `Xiaoqi Tan` </span>

I am a postdoc at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), hosted by Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/leon-garcia-a/).  


Prior to my current position, I received my Ph.D. from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). At HKUST, I was affiliated with the [C2E Group](http://c2e.ece.ust.hk/main/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).
