I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/leon-garcia-a/).  I received my Ph.D. from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). At HKUST, I was affiliated with the [C2E Group](http://c2e.ece.ust.hk/main/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

My research strives to **_navigate fundamental relationships between <span style="color:#00204e">algorithms</span>, <span style="color:#00204e">incentives</span>, and <span style="color:#00204e">performance</span> in the design and management of networked systems_**. I develop new theory and methodologies in <span style="color:#00204E">online algorithms</span>, <span style="color:#00204E">mechanism design</span>, and stochastic models, and focus on applying these methodologies to advance the design of networked systems, markets, and platforms in various domains, ranging from <span style="color:#00204E">computer systems and networks</span> (e.g., cloud computing and network economics)  to <span style="color:#00204E">energy systems</span> (e.g., smart grid and the urban energy-transport nexus). My research features interdisciplinarity and mathematical rigor, utilizing and contributing to algorithms and complexity, economics and computation, performance  evaluation, and artificial intelligence (esp. multi-agent systems).

- My first name "Xiaoqi" is pronounced as "Shiao-Chee".
- I am big fun of [Chinese caligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy). My favorite calligraphers are  [Ouyang Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouyang_Xun) and  [Wang Xizhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xizhi). 
- I am into jogging. This is my favorite place to run in Toronto, weather permitting: [Kay Gardner Beltline Trail](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g155019-d7070406-Reviews-Kay_Gardner_Beltline_Trail-Toronto_Ontario.html).
