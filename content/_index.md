## <span style="color:#00204E"> [XIAOQI TAN](/) </span>

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/leon-garcia-a/). Prior to my current position, I received my Ph.D. from [HKUST](https://hkust.edu.hk/) under Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/) in 2018. At HKUST, I was affiliated with the [C2E Group](http://c2e.ece.ust.hk/main/). During my Ph.D., I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu). 



My research strives to **understand fundamental properties and design principles of large-scale networked systems in the presence of uncertainty, multi-agent interactions, and  possibly strategic behaviors**. In particular, most of my research focuses on developing new mathematical tools in sequential decision-making (e.g., online optimization; online/reinforcement learning; stochastic optimization) and mechanism design, with applications to computer systems & networks, energy systems, electric vehicle networks, and beyond.

[comment]: # (My research strives to understand fundamental performance limits and design principles of large-scale networked systems in the presence of _uncertainty_, _multi-agent interactions_, and even _strategic behaviors_. To deal with such challenging settings, I develop new mathematical tools in _decision-making under uncertainty_ (e.g., online optimization; stochastic modeling and optimization; online and reinforcement learning) and _algorithmic mechanism design_, and focus on applying these tools to address key societal challenges in _computer systems_ \& _networks_, _smart grid_, _electric vehicle networks_, and beyond.

My research strives to _understand fundamental performance limits and design principles of large-scale networked systems in the presence of stochastic dynamics and  multi-agent interactions_. In particular, my recent research focuses primarily on _Online Decision Making under Uncertainty_, and the _Intersection between Algorithms, Mechanism Design, and Game Theory_. On the practical side, I am passionate about applying these techniques to address key societal challenges (e.g., energy sustainability) in a variety of application areas, including _Computer Systems_ \& _Networks_ (e.g., cloud computing, energy-efficient networking, and Internet of Things) and _Cyber-Physical Systems_ (e.g., smart grid and the urban energy-transport nexus).

- My first name "Xiaoqi" is pronounced as "Shiao-Chee".
- I am into jogging. This is my favorite place to run in Toronto, weather permitting: [Kay Gardner Beltline Trail](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g155019-d7070406-Reviews-Kay_Gardner_Beltline_Trail-Toronto_Ontario.html).

[comment]: # (- I am big fun of [Chinese caligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy). My favorite calligraphers are  [Ouyang Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouyang_Xun) and  [Wang Xizhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xizhi).)
