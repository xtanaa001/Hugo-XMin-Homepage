## <span style="color:darkred"> `Xiaoqi Tan` </span>

I am a postdoc at the [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), hosted by Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/leon-garcia-a/).  


Prior to my current position, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

[comment]: # (## <span style="color:darkred">`Research`</span>I am interested in the design and analysis of _Online Algorithms and Mechanisms_, with applications to _Networked Systems_ ranging from computer systems and networks to energy and transportation systems.  My work aims to ensure _Rigor in Systems Research_. To accomplish this, I use tools from optimization,  economics and computation, and machine learning.)


[comment]: # ( This includes, among others, applications arising from developing resource allocation and scheduling decisions to optimize the performance  of _Computer Systems and Networks_, energy markets to integrate distributed energy resources into  _Energy Systems_, and incentive mechanisms to induce desirable behaviors from people and vehicles in _Urban Systems_. My research centers around the theory of `"`Algorithms under Uncertainty`"`, with a focus on developing foundational online algorithms and mechanisms for decision making under uncertainty, using tools from online optimization, algorithmic game theory, and machine learning. the development of efficient resource allocation mechanisms in cloud computing and networks, real-time routing and charging strategies for electric vehicles to achieve a low-carbon transportation, and novel markets to help achieve a clean and resilient energy system.  I am broadly interested in algorithms under uncertainty, with a focus on online algorithms. My research strives to bring sustainability and reliability  into networked systems ranging from  cloud computing to transportation systems and energy systems.

My research interests revolve around fundamental and algorithmic issues in computing, communication, and energy systems.  Beyond my work on applications, I also work on problems at the intersection of online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, and mechanism design. The goal is to develop foundational theory and algorithms for online decision making in the presence of incomplete information, using mathematical tools from computer science, economics, and operations research. Some specific topics of interest include online knapsack problems, online mechanism design, online scheduling, combinatorial auctions, and prophet inequalities. Though diverse, the above areas are all essential to my broader research  goal: developing foundational  algorithms and tools to help improve the sustainability of ICT, or more broadly, to enable a sustainable energy future. Some primary topics in my research include: - [Online Algorithms](/#online-algorithms). Online Optimization and Online Learning. - [Algorithmic Game Theory](/#algorithmic-game-theory). Online Combinatorial Auctions and Mechanism Design. - [Communication Networks](/#networks). Cloud Computing, Network Optimization, and Network Economics. - [Energy Systems](/#energy).
