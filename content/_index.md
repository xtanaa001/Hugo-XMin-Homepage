## About Me
I am a postdoc at the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), hosted by Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/).  Prior to my current position, I obtained my Ph.D. in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/).  From Oct. 2015 to April 2016, I was a visiting student with the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Harvard University, hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/).

## Research Summary

I study the interplay between incentives, algorithms, and learning, with a focus on applications in networking and energy systems (e.g., cloud computing, computer networks, and smart grid).  Current topics of interest include:

> - Algorithmic mechanism design/game theory.
> - Online algorithms and sequential decision-making.
> - Machine learning algorithms and applications.

The long term goal of my research is to create the synergy between economic incentives and learning algorithms to help stakeholders make smarter decisions in managing online platforms in the presence of uncertainty and strategic user behaviors.
