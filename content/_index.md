## Xiaoqi Tan's Bio

I am a postdoc at the [Dept. of ECE](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/).  

Prior to joining UofT, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).
