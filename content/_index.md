## Xiaoqi Tan's Bio

I am a postdoc at the [Dept. of ECE](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/).  

Prior to joining UofT, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

## Research Interests

I work on problems at the intersection of [**online optimization, online learning**](/research/#online_algorithms), and [**mechanism design**](/research/#mechanism_design), with a focus on applications in [**cloud computing**](/research/#cloud_computing), [**communication networks**](/research/#computer_networking) (e.g., dynamic resource allocation and network economics), and [**energy systems**](/research/#energy_systems) (e.g., smart grid, energy-efficient data centers, and electrified transportation).


[comment]: # (*In more detail*: my research centers around the design of algorithms and incentives for networked systems of interacting and possibly self-interested agents. More specifically, my research focuses both on developing analytical techniques in online algorithms, mechanism design, and machine learning, and applying these techniques to  application domains such as cloud computing, computer networking, and energy systems. I work on problems at the intersection of **online decision-making** and **incentives**, with applications to networked systems and platforms. For more details, please click [here](/research). [networked systems and platforms](/research/#research_overview) arising from. and [stochastic models and optimization](/research/#stochastic_models). The main theme is to develop algorithms and incentives for online decision-making in managing networks of interacting and possibly self-interested agents. (e.g., software defined networking and network slicing), and \textbf{\color{UofTblue} energy systems} (e.g., smart grid, energy-efficient data centers, and electrified transportation).)
