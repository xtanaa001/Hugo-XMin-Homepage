## Xiaoqi Tan's Bio

I am a postdoc at the [Dept. of ECE](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/).  

Prior to joining UofT, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

## Research Interests
My research spans various topics in [**economics and computation of networked systems**](/research/). The main theme of my research is to develop analytical techniques in [online algorithms](/research/#OA), [algorithmic game theory](/research/#AGT), and [mechanism design](/research/#ML), and apply these techniques to networked systems such as [cloud computing](/research/#computing), [computer networks](/research/#communication), and [smart grid](/research/#energy). Though diverse, these areas are all essential  to the broader goal of my research: improving the economic and computational efficiency of  network-based applications and services in the presence of  uncertainty.


[comment]: # (Though diverse, these areas all center around the broader theme of my research: improving the _economic and computational efficiency_ of network-based applications and services. in computing, communication, and energy systems. In more detail*: my research centers around the design of algorithms and incentives for networked systems of interacting and possibly self-interested agents. More specifically, my research focuses both on developing analytical techniques in online algorithms, mechanism design, and machine learning, and applying these techniques to  application domains such as cloud computing, computer networking, and energy systems. I work on problems at the intersection of **online decision-making** and **incentives**, with applications to networked systems and platforms. For more details, please click [here](/research). [networked systems and platforms](/research/#research_overview) arising from. and [stochastic models and optimization](/research/#stochastic_models). The main theme is to develop algorithms and incentives for online decision-making in managing networks of interacting and possibly self-interested agents. (e.g., software defined networking and network slicing), and \textbf{\color{UofTblue} energy systems} (e.g., smart grid, energy-efficient data centers, and electrified transportation). In particular, a large part of my research focuses on developing online resource allocation and scheduling decisions in managing systems of interacting and self-interested agents, using tools from [**online algorithms**](/research/#online_algorithms) and [**algorithmic game theory**](/research/#mechanism_design). (e.g., energy-efficient computing and smart grid). The central theme of my research is to develop algorithms and incentives for networks of interacting and possibly self-interested agents in the face of uncertainty, using tools from mathematics, engineering and economics.)
