## Xiaoqi Tan's Bio

I am a postdoc at the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), hosted by Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/). 

Prior to my current position, I obtained my Ph.D. in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/).  From Oct. 2015 to April 2016, I was a visiting student with the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Harvard University, hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/).

## Research Interests

I study the interplay between incentives, algorithms, and learning for the optimization of networked systems. Topics include:

- Algorithmic mechanism design and game theory.
- Online algorithms and sequential decision making.
- Machine learning algorithms and applications.

I am most excited by problems where theoretic results lead to rich insights for the design of real-world platforms in networked systems such as cloud computing, computer networks, and smart grid. The long term goal of my research is to help stakeholders make better decisions in managing platforms in the presence of uncertainty and strategic behaviors.
