## Xiaoqi Tan's Bio

I am a postdoc at the [Dept. of ECE](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/).  

Prior to joining UofT, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

## <a id="research"></a> Research Summary
My research spans various topics in computer networks, cloud computing, and smart grid. The main theme of my research is to develop analytical techniques in online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, and machine learning, and apply these techniques to gain insight into the design of computer and networked systems, markets, and platforms.

[comment]: # (Though diverse, these areas are all essential  to the broader goal of my research: improving the economic and computational efficiency of  network-based applications and services in the presence of  uncertainty.)
