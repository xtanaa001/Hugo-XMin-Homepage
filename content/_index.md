<span style="color:#00204E">**About Me**</span>: 
I am a postdoc at [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), working with Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/leon-garcia-a/). Prior to my current position, I received my Ph.D. from [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/). At HKUST, I was affiliated with the [C2E Group](http://c2e.ece.ust.hk/main/). From October 2015 to April 2016, I was hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/) as a visiting research fellow at the [School of Engineering and Applied Science](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/), [Harvard University](https://harvard.edu).

- I am big fun of [Chinese caligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy). My favorite calligraphers are  [Ouyang Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouyang_Xun) and  [Wang Xizhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xizhi). 
- I am into jogging. This is my favorite place to run in Toronto, weather permitting: [Kay Gardner Beltline Trail](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g155019-d7070406-Reviews-Kay_Gardner_Beltline_Trail-Toronto_Ontario.html).
