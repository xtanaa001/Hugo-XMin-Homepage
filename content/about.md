## About Me

I am a postdoc at the [Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca), [University of Toronto](https://utoronto.ca), hosted by Prof. [Alberto Leon-Garcia](https://www.nal.utoronto.ca/).  

Prior to my current position, I obtained my Ph.D. in electronic and computer engineering from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/) in 2018, advised by Prof. [Danny H.K. Tsang](https://eetsang.home.ece.ust.hk/).  From Oct. 2015 to April 2016, I was a visiting student with the School of Engineering and Applied Science, Harvard University, hosted by Prof. [Na (Lina) Li](https://nali.seas.harvard.edu/).

## Research Interests

<img src="/img/overview.png" style="max-width: 27%; min-width:220px; float: right; margin: 0px 40px" alt="overview"/>

I study the interplay between incentives, algorithms, and learning, with a focus on applications in networked systems (e.g., cloud computing, communication networks, and energy systems). 

A large part of my current research focuses on problems at the intersection of <span style="color:darkblue">mechanism design</span> and <span style="color:darkblue">online algorithms</span>. The goal is to design economic incentives and algorithms that lead to efficient  online decision-making for networked systems despite the presence of  strategic user behaviors and incomplete future information.

Click [here](/research)  for detailed description of my research by topics.

I am most excited by problems where the design of economic incentives and online algorithms provides insight into the operation of  platforms - settings where  resources and services must be managed in  the face of  strategic user behaviors and uncertain future information.
