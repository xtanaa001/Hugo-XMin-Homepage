My research strives to navigate fundamental relationships between <span style="color:#00204e">algorithms</span>, <span style="color:#00204e">incentives</span>, and <span style="color:#00204e">performance</span> in the design and management of networked systems. I develop new theory and methodologies in <span style="color:#00204e">_Online Algorithms_</span>, <span style="color:#00204e">_Mechanism Design_</span>, and <span style="color:#00204e">_Stochastic Models_</span>, and focus on applying these methodologies to advance the design of networked systems, markets, and platforms in various domains, ranging from <span style="color:#00204e">_Computer Systems and Networks_</span>  to <span style="color:#00204e">_Energy Systems_</span>. My research features interdisciplinarity and mathematical rigor, utilizing and contributing to algorithms and complexity, economics and computation, artificial intelligence (esp. multi-agent systems), and machine learning.

- I am big fun of [Chinese caligraphy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_calligraphy). My favorite calligraphers are  [Ouyang Xun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouyang_Xun) and  [Wang Xizhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xizhi).
- I am into jogging. This is my favorite place to run in Toronto, weather permitting: [Kay Gardner Beltline Trail](https://www.tripadvisor.ca/Attraction_Review-g155019-d7070406-Reviews-Kay_Gardner_Beltline_Trail-Toronto_Ontario.html).
