<a id="research_overview"></a>

Many network-based applications and services are carried out by providing resources to systems of interacting agents.  Managing these systems faces two separate, but interrelated, challenges. First, in any system, a good decision, whether that be defined as an algorithm for resource allocation in cloud computing, a strategy for traffic routing in communication networks, or a policy for renewable energy integration in smart grids, are often computed by solving some explicit or implicit optimization problems with incomplete future information. Thus,  performing efficient _online decision-making under uncertainty_ is, in many cases, not just an advantage, but a necessity. Second, and often more difficult, the outcome of a decision-making process often depends on a collective behavior of multiple agents with divergent or even competing interests (and thus, not directly controllable by the system).   As a result, we must design appropriate incentives, based on _economic and game theoretic-models_, to encourage agent interactions towards a desired direction; otherwise, the  decisions cannot be implemented with a guaranteed efficiency and rationality.

To tackle these two challenges, my research focuses both on developing analytical techniques in [**online algorithms**](/research/#online_algorithms), [**algorithmic game theory**](/research/#mechanism_design), and [**machine learning**](/research/#machine_learning), and applying these techniques to improve the economic and computational efficiency of networked systems emerging from application domains such as [**cloud computing**](/research/#computing), [**communication networks**](/research/#networking), and [**smart grid**](/research/#energy). For more details, please see my research description below by topics.

The design of economic incentives, termed as mechanism design, sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and economics, and has led to transformative applications in various domains such as online advertising and on-demand service platforms.

##  Online Algorithms

I am most excited by problems where theoretic results provide rich insights into the design of real-world platforms. For instance, a large part of my current research focuses on problems at the intersection of mechanism design and online algorithms. The goal is to design economic incentives and algorithms that lead to efficient  online decision-making for networked systems despite the presence of  strategic user behaviors and incomplete future information.

##  Algorithmic Game Theory

Research in mechanism design, a subfield of *artificial intelligence*, *economics*, and *game theory*, has led to transformative applications in online marketplaces such as online advertising. In mechainism design, the designer takes an objective-oriented approach to design mechanisms that incentivize self-interested agents/players to follow a certain pattern so as to achieve a desired collective behaivor, assuming that all the agents are rational. 

In this research thrust, we are interested in developing mechanisms that

##  Smart Grid

Machine learning has changed the landscape of many areas in both academy and industry in the past decade. In particular, the success of deep learning in applications such as computer vision and natural language processsing has led to transformative impacts on other communities that were traditionally not relavant.
