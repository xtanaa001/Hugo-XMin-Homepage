My research primarily focuses on developing foundational theories and algorithms for online decision making with incomplete information, using tools from online optimization, algorithmic game theory, and machine learning. On the practical side, my research strives to use analytical techniques to advance our understanding of fundamental performance limits and design principles of networked systems involving multiple stakeholders with divergent or even competing interests. This includes, among others, applications arising from computer systems and networks (e.g., cloud computing), energy systems and markets, and urban transportation systems (e.g., urban energy-transport nexus).  In what follows I describe my research in these areas in detail.

This is also aligned with my long-term vision and philosophy of application-driven interdisciplinary research: neither be too applied by trying _`"`cooking recipes`"`_ without understanding the underlying theoretic  foundations, nor be too theoretical by struggling with _`"`math puzzles`"`_ that may turn out to be irrelevant.)

### Foundations of Online Decision Making

We are witnessing a huge conceptual change in how almost all data is being processed, stored, and shared, and more importantly, in how we view this world by extracting useful information from these data. However, reality is not perfect as oftentimes we need to make decisions, one-shot or sequential, base on real-world information that is incomplete in two fundamental ways:

- First, information is associated with data, and the process of predicting future based on data is necessarily "_uncertain_". In many cases, we may even need to make decisions based on zero knowledge of the future (and hence the term "online"). Thus, a natural question to ask is: <span style="color:navy">How to optimize online decision making, with rigorous and meaningful algorithmic guarantees, based on incomplete or even zero knowledge of future information?</span>

- Second, and often more problematic, some information is inherently “_unreliable_". For example, much of the world is systems of interacting agents, and the management of these networked systems often involves multiple agents whose behaviors are strategic. This, inevitably, leads to situations that invaluable information are not truthfully revealed and shared for the "common good". Thus, when facing such systems of interacting and strategic agents, an intricate question to ask is: <span style="color:navy">How to incentivize agents to make individual and group decisions in a certain way so that a desired performance can be achieved despite the existence of strategic behaviors?</span>


To answer these two questions, a truly multidisciplinary approach is necessary. Study of online optimization and online algorithms, a classic field in computer science and operations research, concerns about how to compare the performance of an algorithm that operates with _no knowledge of the future_ (online) with the performance of the optimal _clairvoyant_ strategy that has complete knowledge of the future (ofﬂine). Research in algorithmic game theory and mechanism design, a subfield at the intersection of theoretic computer science, economics, and artiﬁcial intelligence, studies how to design and analyze _incentive-aware algorithms_ (a.k.a mechanisms) when there exist strategic interactions between self-interested agents. Over the past decades, both of these two fields have developed transformative applications, such as the modern platform of Internet advertising and sponsored search. However, these two fields have also indentified many algorithmic challenges in the design of systems for supporting emerging real-time applications such as autonomous mobility in urban systems and renewable energy integration in energy systems. My research in this area focuses on foundational algorithmic problems, with a particular focus on _Online Knapsack Problems_, _Online Combinatorial Auctions_, _Online Scheduling_, and _Multi-Armed Bandits_.

### Networked Systems: Algorithms and Markets

Some of the most concerning issues facing the world (e.g. climate change) are, directly or indirectly, governed by _networks of engineering and social systems_, where services and utilities are provided by sharing physical resources and infrastructures among people with divergent or even competing interests. The performance of these systems, whether that be deﬁned as the job completion time in cloud computing, the carbon emission of electricity generation in power grid, or the traffic congestion in urban systems, are determined not only by the availability of physical resources, but also behavioral patterns of the people served by these systems. Thus, to understand fundamental performance limits and design principles of these networked systems of large-scale social impacts, we not only need to develop efficient algorithmic and computational tools to better manage physical resources in engineering systems, but novel markets and incentives to incentivize human behaviors deemed desirable for the “common good" of the social system (e.g., welfare maximization). _Such an intertwined interaction between networks of engineering and social systems calls for a multidisciplinary and holistic approach in algorithm and market design_. This is also the primary driving force of my research in following three application domains:

[comment]: # (Energy sustainability is deemed to have profound impacts on some of the most concerning global issues in the 21st century (e.g. climate change).  The energy consumption from the expanding use of information and communication technology is unsustainable with present drivers (e.g., the electricity consumption of a large-scale data center is comparable to a small town), and it will also impact heavily on other sectors such as intelligent transportation systems and smart power grids.  To bring sustainability and reliability into these networked systems of large-scale  social impacts, we need to form a multidisciplinary community with a holistic and systematic approach. This means that we not only need technological development from electronics and devices in the microarchitecture level (e.g., power-efficient chip design), but also algorithmic and computational advances in the system level so as to fully improve the energy efficiency of computing and communication, and more importantly, to harness low-carbon but volatile resources, such as renewable energy, for the development of green computing and networking (e.g., sustainable data centers), electrified transportation (e.g., ridesharing platforms based on electrified, connected, and possibly autonomous vehicles), and more broadly, a clean and resilient energy system (e.g., flexible integration of rooftop solar, wind, and energy storage into the power grid).)  

- **Computer Systems and Networks**. With the democratization of cloud computing, diverse users demand computer system resources and services from geo-distributed data centers. The rise of serverless computing further simplifies the deployment of cloud applications by delivering a true “_pay-as-you-go_" model, based on which customers only pay for the resources that are actually being used with almost inﬁnite scalability. On the other hand, software deﬁned networking and network function virtualization are driving network architecture to evolve more towards a software platform, which provides ﬂexible and automatic availability of network resources (e.g., in the form of network slices) tailed to users with different requirements. Such an elastic and agile network architecture is considered to be one of the core deliverables in 5G and beyond. These technological evolutions in computing and networking, however, pose a unique challenge to the management of network-based applications and services: <span style="color:navy">How to perform efﬁcient and elastic allocation of computing and communication resources, in an on-demand and real-time manner, to users with diverse, highly dynamic, and sometimes even unpredictable and strategic, behavioral patterns?</span>

- **Energy Systems and Markets**. The current power grid is expected to evolve signiﬁcantly over the next few decades to become more sustainable and resilient. One of the most signiﬁcant evolution is the massive integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), e.g., rooftop solar, wind, and battery storage, into the edge of the power grid. However, in the absence of effective tools and methodologies to manage high levels of DERs, the power networks will experience severe stability issues such as frequency and voltage variations due to the inherent uncertainty and variability of DERs. To this end, a fundamental challenge in making the power grid more sustainable and resilient is: <span style="color:navy">How to develop reliable, efﬁcient, and fair energy markets to manage a large number of heterogeneous DERs with different output characteristics in terms of uncertainty, variability, and cost basis?</span>

- **Urban Systems and Energy-Transport Nexus**. The transportation sector accounts for a substantial portion of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. It is, therefore, conceived that the massive development of electric vehicles (EVs), augmented with advanced EV charging strategies and infrastructures, will be one of the most promising solutions to signiﬁcantly reduce carbon emissions. On the other hand, disruptive business models and technological development have revolutionized our way of commuting and traveling, e.g., ridesharing and mobility-on-demand, and it is almost surely that the majority of these novel mobility services will be delivered by EVs (possibly driverless) in the near future. This creates a complex _urban energy-transport nexus_ with a pressing challenge faced by urban planners: <span style="color:navy">How to efﬁciently coordinate energy and mobility services in urban energy-transport nexus so as to contribute to carbon emission and trafﬁc congestion reduction?</span>


Though traditionally investigated in different disciplines, all these conceptual and technological evolutions share a common design principle of what I call "Human-in-the-loop On-demand Platforms + X ": _An on-demand platform, with shared physical resources and infrastructures, that provides computing-, communication-, energy-, and mobility-as-a-service (or X-as-a-service)_. Making progresses in these areas provides a uniﬁed perspective to understand fundamental properties and design principles of many real-world network-based applications and services (e.g., how to price function-as-a-service in serverless computing with fairness guarantee?), not to mention its vast consequences for pressing challenges such as energy sustainability, trafﬁc congestion, and climate change, etc. In the pursue of these research goals, I develop new mathematical models, algorithms, and markets  to improve the system design in cloud computing, computer networks, urban mobility systems, and smart grid. For more details, you can see my papers in this [area](/publications_topic/#networks).


[comment]: # (First, in most real-world systems, data are revealed  in a sequential manner, and our knowledge of future information is necessarily noisy. Thus, making "intelligent" decisions based on uncertain and constantly-updating data is, in many cases, not just an advantage, but a necessity. Second, and often more difficult, much of the world is networks of interacting and possibly self-interested agents, and the management of these networked systems often involve resource allocation among agents whose preferences are private and whose behaviors are strategic. This, inevitably, leads to situations that invaluable data are not truthfully shared for the "common good". Thus, to have a good system design, we must take incentive issues into consideration; otherwise, a desired and reliable  system performance cannot be achieved with efficiency and rationality guarantee.  .... ranging from communication networks to transportation systems and energy systems. these systems can all be modeled as networks of interacting agents, sharing and competing limited resources under stochastic dynamics.  Thus, a good system design, whether that be defined as an algorithm for job scheduling in cloud computing, a policy for network routing in communication networks, or a strategy for managing distributed energy resources (e.g., renewable energy and electric vehicles) in smart grids,  is often computed based on imperfect data inputs that are revealed in an online and sequential manner only.  My research has been interdisciplinary in nature, spanning various topics in `Engineering`, `Computer Science`, and `Economics`. Broadly, my research in these areas is what I call "**`Algorithmic System Design + X`**": adopting an algorithmic perspective, with systems thinking, to approach diverse applications in science and engineering. This is also aligned with my long-term vision and philosophy of being a system researcher: neither be too applied by trying "_`cooking recipes`_" without consideration of the underlying theoretic foundations, nor be too theoretical by ignoring practical limitations or even having no well-motivated applications at all.  whether that be defined as a cloud platform for running computing jobs, or an energy market for charging electric vehicles, Some primal topics in my research include cloud resource allocation, network optimization, network economics, electric vehicle charging scheduling, electricity markets, and distributed energy storage systems. )
