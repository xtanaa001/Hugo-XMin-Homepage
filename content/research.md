My research centers around the design of efficient decisions for resource allocation and scheduling in networked systems. My research is primarily driven by the following intrigue question:

<span style="color:darkblue"> 
How to improve the performance of resource allocation and scheduling in networked systems in the face of **strategic user behaviors** and **uncertain future information**?
</span>

To answer this question, I study the interplay between incentives, algorithms, and learning. In particular, my research focuses both on developing analytical techniques in `mechanism design`, `online algorithms`, and `machine learning`, and applying these techniques to application domains such as `cloud computing`, `communication networks`, and `energy systems`.  The long term goal of my research is to provide insights into how to tackle societal challenges such as energy sustainability, network security, traffic congestion, and climate change.

I am most excited by problems where theoretic results provide rich insights into the design of real-world platforms. For instance, a large part of my current research focuses on problems at the intersection of mechanism design and online algorithms. The goal is to design economic incentives and algorithms that lead to efficient  online decision-making for networked systems despite the presence of  strategic user behaviors and incomplete future information.
