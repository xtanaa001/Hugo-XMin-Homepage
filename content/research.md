Many computer and networked systems can be modelled as networks of interacting agents sharing and competing for limited resources. Managing resources in these systems faces two separate, but interrelated, challenges. First, in any system, a good decision, whether that be defined as an algorithm for resource allocation and scheduling in the clouds, a strategy for packet forwarding and routing in the Internet, or a policy for integration of distributed energy resources (e.g., renewable energy, plug-in electric vehicles, and energy storage, etc.) in smart grids, are often computed by solving some explicit or implicit optimization problems with incomplete knowledge of the future. Thus,  performing efficient *online decision-making* in the face of information uncertainty is, in many cases, not just an advantage, but a necessity. Second, and often more difficult, the performance of a decision-making process often depends on a collective behavior of multiple agents whose preferences are divergent or even strategic (and thus, not directly controllable by the system). As a result, we must design appropriate incentives, based on economic and game-theoretic models, to facilitate autonomous *distributed decision-making* among multiple agents; otherwise, the  decision-making cannot be implemented with a guaranteed efficiency and rationality. 


My research is primarily motivated by these two challenges and centers around the optimization of computer and networked systems in the presence of uncertainty and strategic behavior. To tackle this research agenda, my research focuses both on developing analytical techniques in online/distributed algorithms, algorithmic game theory, and machine learning, and applying these techniques to real-world networked systems such as cloud computing, computer networks, and smart grid. For more details, please see my [publications](/publications). 



[commet]: # (The broader goal of my research is to optimize the decision-making in computer and networked systems in the presence of incomplete information in either the temporal domain (i.e., knowledge of the future), or the spatial domain (i.e., preferences/behaviors of the agents), or both.  ) 


[comment]: # (I believe that solutions to alleviate or resolve these research challenges provide insights into how to tackle many societal challenges such as computing efficiency, cyber security, energy sustainability, traffic congestion, and climate change, etc. e.g., random job arrivals in cloud computing or volatile renewable energy generation in energy systems. The design of economic incentives, termed as mechanism design, sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and economics, and has led to transformative applications in various domains such as online advertising and on-demand service platforms. My research)

[comment]: # (For examples, how incentives influence the behavior of self-interested agents, and thus the peformance of online decisions? how online decisions influence the outcome of incentives if there exist zero knowledge of future information? )
