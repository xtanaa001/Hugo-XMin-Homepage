My research centers on addressing the challenges emerging from the design and operation of real-world networked systems, e.g.,  cloud computing, communication networks, and energy systems.  The key research question that drives my research is as follows: 

How to make better decisions in managing networked systems so that a desired objective can be achieved despite the presence of **strategic behaviors** and **information uncertainty**?

To answer the above two questions, I study the interplay between incentives, algorithms, and learning.  I believe solutions to the above problem can help us gain insights into how to tackle many societal challenges that include  energy sustainability, network security, traffic congestion, and climate change.

## 1. Online Algorithms: A Primal-Dual Framework

I am most excited by problems where theoretic results provide rich insights into the design of real-world platforms. For instance, a large part of my current research focuses on problems at the intersection of mechanism design and online algorithms. The goal is to design economic incentives and algorithms that lead to efficient  online decision-making for networked systems despite the presence of  strategic user behaviors and incomplete future information.

There are two layout files under `layouts/partials/` that you may want to override: `head_custom.html` and `foot_custom.html`.  This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:

$$
\begin{align}
& \max  & & \sum _ {n=1}^N v_n x_n - \sum _ {t=1}^T f_t\Big(\sum _ {n=1}^N r_n^t x_n\Big),\\\\\
& \ s.t. & & \sum _ {n=1}^N r_n^t x_n\leq 1, \forall t\in\mathcal{T},\\\\\
& & & x_n = \{0,1\}, \forall n = \{1,2,\cdots,N\}.
\end{align}
$$
