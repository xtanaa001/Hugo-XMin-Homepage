I study the interplay between incentives, algorithms, and learning, with a focus on applications in networks, markets, and energy systems (e.g., cloud computing, computer networks, and smart grid).  Current topics of interest include:

In particular, I am most excited by problems where theoretic results lead to rich insights for the design of real-world platforms in networked systems such as cloud computing, computer networks, and smart grid. 

The long term goal of my research is to create the synergy between economic incentives and engineering algorithms to help stakeholders make smarter decisions in managing online platforms in the presence of uncertainty and strategic user behaviors.

## 1. Online Algorithms: A Primal-Dual Framework

There are two layout files under `layouts/partials/` that you may want to override: `head_custom.html` and `foot_custom.html`.  This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:

$$
\begin{align}
& \max  & & \sum _ {n=1}^N v_n x_n - \sum _ {t=1}^T f_t\Big(\sum _ {n=1}^N r_n^t x_n\Big),\\\\\
& \ s.t. & & \sum _ {n=1}^N r_n^t x_n\leq 1, \forall t\in\mathcal{T},\\\\\
& & & x_n = \{0,1\}, \forall n = \{1,2,\cdots,N\}.
\end{align}
$$

**Application 1: Network Resource Allocation**

This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:

**Application 2: Electric Vehicle Charging in Smart Grid**

This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:

This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:

**Application 3: Vehicle Routing in Transportation Networks**

This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:

$$ \psi'(p) = \frac{1}{\varphi'\left(\varphi^{-1}(p)\right)} = \frac{1}{\varphi'(y)}. $$
