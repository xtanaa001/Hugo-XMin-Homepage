My research lies in economics and computation of networked systems, with particular applications to computer networks, cloud computing, and smart grid.  The main theme of my research is driven by two separate, but interrelated, challenges, in the development of network-based applications and services in computation and communication.  First, in any system, a good decision, whether that be defined as a strategy for network routing in the Internet, an algorithm for resource allocation in cloud computing, or a policy for renewable energy integration in smart grid, are often computed by solving some explicit or implicit optimization problems with incomplete knowledge of future information. Thus,  making efficient **online decisions** under **data uncertainty** (or even no data in the worst case) is, in many cases, not just an advantage, but a necessity. Second, and often more difficult, the outcome of a decision-making process often depends on a collective behavior of multiple stakeholders/agents whose preferences may  be divergent or even strategic. As a result, we must design appropriate **economic incentives**, based on game theoretic-models, to encourage agent interactions towards a desired direction; otherwise, the  decisions cannot be implemented with a guaranteed efficiency and rationality. 


To address these two challenges, my research focuses on developing analytical techniques in online algorithms, algorithmic game theory, and machine learning, and applying these techniques to improve the economic and computational efficiency of network-based applications and services in the presence of data uncertainty and strategic agents. For more details, please see my [publications](/publications).

In particular, a large part of my current research focuses on [**online algorithms**](/research/#online_algorithms) and [**algorithmic game theory**](/research/#mechanism_design). The goal is to develop algorithms and incentives for efficient online decision-making in managing networked systems of interacting and possibly self-interested agents. ) 


[comment]: # (I believe that solutions to alleviate or resolve these research challenges provide insights into how to tackle many societal challenges such as computing efficiency, cyber security, energy sustainability, traffic congestion, and climate change, etc. e.g., random job arrivals in cloud computing or volatile renewable energy generation in energy systems. The design of economic incentives, termed as mechanism design, sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and economics, and has led to transformative applications in various domains such as online advertising and on-demand service platforms. My research)

[comment]: # (For examples, how incentives influence the behavior of self-interested agents, and thus the peformance of online decisions? how online decisions influence the outcome of incentives if there exist zero knowledge of future information? )
