- _Is it possible to make good decisions when there exists no knowledge of the future?_
- _How to efficiently allocate and utilize resources in a system with self-interested agents?_	
- _Can we provably  learn from data that becomes available in a piece-by-piece manner?_

At ﬁrst glance, this looks like a hodgepodge of unrelated questions. Surprisingly, the research community has discovered over the past twenty years that these questions are closely related. They can all be fruitfully studied under the umbrella of computation and economics of networked systems, an interdisciplinary ﬁeld with myriad applications in real-world systems such as cloud computing, computer networks, Internet of Things, and energy systems. The goal of my research is to understand the fundamental performance limits of such systems in the presence of real-time data held by self-interested agents, and seeks to provide strategic and operational insights using computational tools from the areas of optimization, game theory, and machine learning.



[commet]: # (The broader goal of my research is to optimize the decision-making in computer and networked systems in the presence of incomplete information in either the temporal domain (i.e., knowledge of the future), or the spatial domain (i.e., preferences/behaviors of the agents), or both.  ) 


[comment]: # (I believe that solutions to alleviate or resolve these research challenges provide insights into how to tackle many societal challenges such as computing efficiency, cyber security, energy sustainability, traffic congestion, and climate change, etc. e.g., random job arrivals in cloud computing or volatile renewable energy generation in energy systems. The design of economic incentives, termed as mechanism design, sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and economics, and has led to transformative applications in various domains such as online advertising and on-demand service platforms. My research)

[comment]: # (For examples, how incentives influence the behavior of self-interested agents, and thus the peformance of online decisions? how online decisions influence the outcome of incentives if there exist zero knowledge of future information? )
