title: Research

I study the interplay between incentives, algorithms, and learning, with a focus on applications in networks, markets, and energy systems (e.g., cloud computing, computer networks, and smart grid).  Current topics of interest include:


The long term goal of my research is to create the synergy between economic incentives and engineering algorithms to help stakeholders make smarter decisions in managing online platforms in the presence of uncertainty and strategic user behaviors.

## 1. Online Algorithms

There are two layout files under `layouts/partials/` that you may want to override: `head_custom.html` and `foot_custom.html`. 

<img src="/img/three_layer_smart_cities.png" style="max-width:80%; min-width:40px; float: center" alt="Xiaoqi Tan"/>


This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:

$$ \psi'(p) = \frac{1}{\varphi'\left(\varphi^{-1}(p)\right)} = \frac{1}{\varphi'(y)}. $$

## 3. Online Learning

I could have added more features to this theme, but I decided not to, since I have no intention to make this theme feature-rich. However, I will teach you how. I have prepared several examples via pull requests at https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin/pulls, so that you can see the implementations of these features when you check out the diffs in the pull requests. For example, you can:

To fully understand these examples, you have to read [the section on Hugo templates](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html) in the **blogdown** book.
