We are living in the world with ubiquitous networks of interacting and self-interested agents.  Managing resources and services in these networked systems faces two separate, but interrelated, challenges. First, in any system, a good decision, whether that be defined as an algorithm for resource allocation in the clouds, a strategy for  traffic routing in computer networks, or a policy for electricity distribution in power grids, are often computed with <span style="color:darkblue"> incomplete knowledge of the future</span>. Thus, making decisions in an online fashion (with or without prediction) is, in many cases, not just an advantage, but a necessity. Second, and often more difficult, the implementation of any decision must involve <span style="color:darkblue">a collective behavior of agents that are often self-interested and strategic</span>, as a result,  we must design appropriate incentives, commonly studied in the field of mechanism design, to encourage agent interactions (towards a desired direction) so that the decisions can be implemented in real-world networked systems and platforms. 

Motivated by these two challenges, my research  centers around understanding the interplay between online decision-making  and  incentives. More specifically, my research focuses both on developing analytical techniques in [online algorithms](/research/#online_algorithms), [mechanism design](/research/#mechanism_design), and [machine learning](/research/#machine_learning), and applying these techniques to improve the design and operation of networked systems and platforms arising from application domains such as <span style="color:darkblue">cloud computing</span>, <span style="color:darkblue">computer networking</span>,  and <span style="color:darkblue">energy systems</span>.   I believe that solutions to these two research challenges can provide insights into how to tackle more momentous societal challenges such as cyber security, energy sustainability, and climate change, etc. 


[comment]: # (I believe that solutions to alleviate or resolve these research challenges provide insights into how to tackle many societal challenges such as computing efficiency, cyber security, energy sustainability, traffic congestion, and climate change, etc. e.g., random job arrivals in cloud computing or volatile renewable energy generation in energy systems)

[comment]: # (For examples, how incentives influence the behavior of self-interested agents, and thus the peformance of online decisions? how online decisions influence the outcome of incentives if there exist zero knowledge of future information? )

## 2. <a id="online_algorithms"></a> Online Knapsack Problems with Packing Costs

I am most excited by problems where theoretic results provide rich insights into the design of real-world platforms. For instance, a large part of my current research focuses on problems at the intersection of mechanism design and online algorithms. The goal is to design economic incentives and algorithms that lead to efficient  online decision-making for networked systems despite the presence of  strategic user behaviors and incomplete future information.
