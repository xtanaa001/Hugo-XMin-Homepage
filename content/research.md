Many network-based applications and services are carried out by providing resources for systems of interacting  agents in a dynamic environment. Managing resources in these systems faces two separate, but interrelated, challenges. First, in any system, a good decision, whether that be defined as an algorithm for resource allocation in the clouds, a strategy for traffic routing in the Internet, or a policy for renewable energy integration in smart grids, are often computed by solving some explicit or implicit optimization problems with incomplete knowledge of the future. Thus,  performing efficient *online decision-making* in the face of data/information uncertainty is, in many cases, not just an advantage, but a necessity. Second, and often more difficult, the outcome of a decision-making process often depends on a collective behavior of multiple stakeholders/agents whose preferences are divergent or even strategic (and thus, not directly controllable by the system). As a result, we must design appropriate incentives and protocols, based on economic and game theoretic-models, to facilitate *distributed decision-making* among multiple agents; otherwise, the  decision-making cannot be implemented with a guaranteed efficiency and rationality. 


To address these two challenges, my research primarily contributes to the study of *online and distributed computation* of networked systems, with a particular focus on applications in cloud computing, computer networks, and energy systems.  More specifically, my research focuses both on developing analytical techniques in online/distributed algorithms, algorithmic game theory/mechanism design, and machine learning, and applying these techniques to improve the economic and computational efficiency of networked systems in the presence of incomplete information in either the temporal domain (i.e., knowledge of the future), or the spatial domain (i.e., behaviors of the agents), or both. For more details, please see my [publications](/publications).

In particular, a large part of my current research focuses on [**online algorithms**](/research/#online_algorithms) and [**algorithmic game theory**](/research/#mechanism_design). The goal is to develop algorithms and incentives for efficient online decision-making in managing networked systems of interacting and possibly self-interested agents. ) 


[comment]: # (I believe that solutions to alleviate or resolve these research challenges provide insights into how to tackle many societal challenges such as computing efficiency, cyber security, energy sustainability, traffic congestion, and climate change, etc. e.g., random job arrivals in cloud computing or volatile renewable energy generation in energy systems. The design of economic incentives, termed as mechanism design, sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and economics, and has led to transformative applications in various domains such as online advertising and on-demand service platforms.

[comment]: # (For examples, how incentives influence the behavior of self-interested agents, and thus the peformance of online decisions? how online decisions influence the outcome of incentives if there exist zero knowledge of future information? )
