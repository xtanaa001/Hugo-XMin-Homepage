Many platform-based services are carried out by sharing resources  among networks of interacting and self-interested agents.  Making decisions in managing these networked systems and platforms faces two separate, but interrelated, challenges. First, in any system, a good decision, whether that be defined as an algorithm for computing resource allocation in the clouds, a strategy for  traffic routing in the Internet, or a policy for electricity distribution in electric power networks, are often computed by solving some explicit or implicit optimization problems with incomplete knowledge of the future (e.g., piece-by-piece input). Thus, _making decisions in an online fashion_ (with or without prediction) is, in many cases, not just an advantage, but a necessity. Second, and often more difficult, the performance of a decision-making process often depends on a collective behavior of agents that may act strategically (and thus, cannot be forced to follow the decisions made by the platform). For this reason,  we must _design appropriate incentives to encourage agent interactions_ towards a desired direction, otherwise the decisions cannot be implemented with a guaranteed efficiency and rationality. 

My research is primarily motivated by these two challenges and centers around  the interplay between  online decision-making  and  incentives in networked systems and platforms. More specifically, my research focuses both on developing analytical techniques in *online algorithms*, *mechanism design*, and *machine learning*, and applying these techniques to  the resource allocation and scheduling in  networked systems and platforms  arising from application domains such as *cloud computing*, *computer networking*, and *energy systems*.

The design of economic incentives, termed as mechanism design, sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and economics, and has led to transformative applications in various domains such as online advertising and on-demand service platforms.

I am most excited by problems where theoretic results provide rich insights into the design of real-world platforms. For instance, a large part of my current research focuses on problems at the intersection of mechanism design and online algorithms. The goal is to design economic incentives and algorithms that lead to efficient  online decision-making for networked systems despite the presence of  strategic user behaviors and incomplete future information.

*Applications*. Online decision-making is resource allocation in computer networks. This is how you inject arbitrary HTML code to the head and foot areas. For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically. *App 2: Vehicle Routing in Transportation Networks*.

For example, this site has a file `layouts/partials/foot_custom.html` to support LaTeX math via MathJax and center images automatically:

##  <a id="mechanism_design"></a> Mechanism Design

Research in mechanism design, a subfield of *artificial intelligence*, *economics*, and *game theory*, has led to transformative applications in online marketplaces such as online advertising. In mechainism design, the designer takes an objective-oriented approach to design mechanisms that incentivize self-interested agents/players to follow a certain pattern so as to achieve a desired collective behaivor, assuming that all the agents are rational. 

In this research thrust, we are interested in developing mechanisms that

## <a id="machine_learning"></a>  Machine Learning

Machine learning has changed the landscape of many areas in both academy and industry in the past decade. In particular, the success of deep learning in applications such as computer vision and natural language processsing has led to transformative impacts on other communities that were traditionally not relavant.

In this thrust, our major focus is on the interaction between machine learning  and mechanism design, as well as how learning can help online decision-makings. Two particular topics of interests include

- **Data-Driven Mechanism Design**. 

- **Online Learning**.
