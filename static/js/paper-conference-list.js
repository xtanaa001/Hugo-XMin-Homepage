        paperAbstract : "<p>We study a general online resource allocation problem, where a service provider sells multiple types of capacity-limited resources to heterogeneous customers that arrive in a sequential manner. The provider charges payment from customers who purchase the resource but must pay an increasing marginal supply cost with respect to the total resource allocated (e.g., production costs and/or operational costs). The goal is to maximize the social welfare, namely, the total valuation of customers minus the total supply cost of the provider. We adopt the standard competitive analysis framework and provide an optimal online posted-pricing mechanism. Our online mechanism is optimal in the sense that no other online algorithms can achieve a better competitive ratio.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>In this paper, we study resource allocation (including power and computation resources) and channel assignment in an uplink Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA)-based Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) system. Our objective is to minimize the total energy consumption of all users. The problem, however, is a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem. We first investigate the hidden convexity by reformulating the resource allocation problem when the channel assignment is given, and propose an efficient algorithm to allocate the resources by dual decomposition methods. Furthermore, we design a heuristic algorithm to decide the channel assignment leveraging the structural property in the reformulation. Extensive simulations verify that NOMA has great advantages over Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) in multi-user latency-intensive MEC systems.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>With the rise of transportation electrification, autonomous driving and shared mobility in urban mobility systems, and increasing penetrations of distributed energy resources and autonomous demand-side management techniques in energy systems, tremendous opportunities, as well as challenges, are emerging in the forging of a sustainable and converged urban mobility and energy future. This paper is motivated by these disruptive transformations and gives an overview of managing autonomous mobility and energy services in future smart cities. First, we propose a three-layer architecture for the convergence of future mobility and energy systems. For each layer, we give a brief overview of the disruptive transformations that directly contribute to the rise of autonomous mobility-on-demand (AMoD) systems. Second, we propose the concept of autonomous flexibility-on-demand (AFoD), as an energy service platform built directly on existing infrastructures of AMoD systems. In the vision of AFoD, autonomous electric vehicles provide charging flexibilities as a service on demand in energy systems. Third, we analyze and compare AMoD and AFoD, and we identify four key decisions that, if appropriately coordinated, will create a synergy between AMoD and AFoD. Finally, we discuss key challenges towards the success of AMoD and AFoD in future smart cities and present some key research directions regarding the system-wide coordination between AMoD and AFoD.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>We present a framework to integrate the choice of electric vehicle (EV) customers into the vehicle-to-station (V2S) routing problem for battery swapping. Instead of assigning stations to each EV customer directly, we provide a recommendation, including a list of station-price pairs that are available for EV battery swapping services, for customers to choose. Compared with assignment, recommendation is closer to reality for scenarios lacking incentives for the cooperation of customers such as the battery swapping services of private EVs. In this paper, we model customersâ€™ behavior by their choice probability given a particular recommendation, which can be readily obtained based on analytics techniques once the real data are available. We propose an online V2S recommendation algorithm, which aims at maximizing the expected revenue of a group of battery swapping stations (BSSs) and ensuring the quality service of EV customers. Leveraging the primal-dual analysis, we show that the loss of revenue due to online EV arrivals is theoretically bounded by a provable competitive ratio. Moreover, numerical tests also validate that the proposed online algorithm can significantly outperform benchmarks in maximizing revenues in online settings.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>This paper proposes a novel electric vehicle (EV) charging scheduling mechanism by controlling active and reactive charging power of EVs to provide joint voltage and frequency regulation (JVFR) in the distribution network. The objective of the scheduling problem is to minimize the net cost of the distribution system operator (DSO) for operating the distribution grid in the presence of both wind-based renewable generation and EV charging stations. We test the method on a 34-bus radial distribution network for different levels of VAR requirements of wind DG units to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed JVFR approach. The simulation results show that this JVFR greatly reduces the cost of DSO in comparison with Volt-VAR Optimization (VVO) technique, which is traditionally used to optimize voltage and minimize losses of a distribution network.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as renewable generation, energy storage and flexible loads have been acknowledged as the key drivers to transform the passive distribution networks into proactive players in the electricity market. In order to reduce the communication and computational complexity of integrating the huge number of DERs into the power system operation, the distribution system operator (DSO) is considered as the central controller to take charge of the dispatch of all the DERs within a distribution network. Through the exchange of boundary power flows and control signals, the independent system operator (ISO) coordinates all the DSOs to achieve certain social objective. In this paper, we study the interactions between the ISO and all the DSOs in both the dayahead market and the real-time balancing market. Particularly, we identify that the locational marginal price (LMP) based realtime market is unfair and discourages the integration of DERs. To achieve a win-win solution for both the ISO and the DSOs, we propose a real-time coordination mechanism to determine the power dispatch and the corresponding charge/payments via a Nash bargaining problem. Numerical results show that our proposed mechanism guarantees that the ISO and all the DSOs can cooperatively maximize the social welfare and share the benefits fairly due to the cooperation.</p>",

        paperAbstract : "<p>Demand side management (DSM) exploits flexibility of the end-user side to help improve the performance of the power grid. However, how to model and evaluate the multi-dimensional flexibility (MDF) of the energy consumers (such as the flexibilities in terms of energy, power, time period and locations, etc.) is an important and challenging issue. To handle this, we propose a day-ahead market design for the MDF services. In this market, the MDF aggregators need to submit the characteristics of their virtual battery models and parametric reward functions, which represent the aggregate load flexibilities and the required remunerations, respectively. One key feature of this new market is that the system operator is allowed to accept only a portion of every bid instead of the whole of them. This can bring more flexibilities for the operator to minimize the total system cost. With various case studies on a 6-bus transmission network, we show that this market can help flatten the locational marginal prices (LMPs) across the peak load period. Moreover, we show that even if the MDF bids at different buses are the same, the clearing results can be quite different, which reflect the practical values of different load flexibilities from the perspective of the system operator.</p>",
